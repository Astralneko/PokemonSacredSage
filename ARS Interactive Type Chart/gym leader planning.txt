2: +5
5, 8, 13: +6

===============================================================
ZANTARU - Aster League
===============================================================
Zantaru has nine Gyms instead of eight. Each one still has 1 type, although there are three Elite Trainers instead of four. The Pokémon League is on Mount Aster, the tallest mountain in Zantaru’s eastern mountain range. The Gym types are like this:
Aminade City's Flying Trial Captain - Avery - Ace: Sweetwan
Â's B's F's H's T's O's Funny
Mundibeau City's Bug Trial Captain - Beatrice - Ace: Vulcantern
Idolda City's Electric Trial Captain - Circa - Ace: Vanishux
Lagano City's Water Trial Captain - Joaquin - Ace: Lillinimba
Kurtail City's Ghost Trial Captain - Azrani - Ace: Shedinja
Avemara City's Ground Trial Captain - Trenton - Ace: Ratterup
Tekakon City's Dark Trial Captain - Nicole - Ace: Lucenare
Raicha City's Psychic Trial Captain - Gloria - Ace: Bellenhime
Leyendo City's Steel Trial Captain - Gabriel - Ace: Carridillo
Each of the Gyms do not offer a badge, rather, a nine-segmented pendant is used instead, which is marked with the proper color as each Gym is completed. There are two versions that are alternated every year - one themed after fire, the other after water.

The Elite Trainers challenged before the Champion are handpicked by the Champion, and change when the Champion position is replaced usually, but Prof. Maple (the replacement for the late Ezuku Babel) does not replace them. They are:
Fighting Elite Four - 
Grass Elite Four - Yucca
Dragon Elite Four - Sigurd
Normal Elite Four - Boris
Champion Ezuku - Ace: Gemallen
Champion Ann Maple - Ace: Kumeichan

In general: Think of the Aster League as a combination of the Alola League and literally any other region's League.
===============================================================
SILATI - Silati League
===============================================================
It has the normal League format.
Batagna's Water Gym Leader - Aquarius
Melagrande's Fire Gym Leader - Aries
Lamporayo's Electric Gym Leader - Zachari
Celiccia's Flying Gym Leader - Libra
Tuzuccani's Psychic Gym Leader - Harle
Narancia's Fighting Gym Leader - Mino
Moranea's Dark Gym Leader - Lucy
Neolive's Steel Gym Leader - Platinum
Áy
Ghost Elite Four - Dante
Ground Elite Four - Pierre
Poison Elite Four - Molly
Glitch Elite Four - Hazzel
Champion Sirius
===============================================================
XUREEN - Xureen League
===============================================================
Similar to the Aster League, but badges are used. No Gym Leader types are duplicated between the Aster and Xureen Leagues, though that is just coincidence. The only types between the two that remain unused are Glitch and Grass, the latter being the previous type of Evelyn’s Gym before that Gym Leader retired and the former being Mackenzie's specialty. There is also no Elite 4 or anything like it, rather, several Trainers, including the current top 4 available Trainers from previous sessions battle in a biannual tournament, similarly to the Galar League.
Malchan's Normal Gym Leader - Evelyn - Ace: Lucideon
Marinel's Fire Gym Leader - Savannah - Ace: Cherrykaze
New Motostoke's Rock Gym Leader - Rory - Ace: Graphirida
Morrighan's Ice Gym Leader - Claudia - Ace: Kochisuria
Catiran's Celestial Gym Leader - Rosana - Ace: X. Inkdian
Tanopal's Fairy Gym Leader - Sylvester - Ace: Alikurumi
Safiran's Dragon Gym Leader - Wyatt - Ace: Velocragma
Osbedol's Fighting Gym Leader - Nina - Ace: Tessukuren
Peraday's Poison Gym Leader - Mary Jane - Ace: Mawberry-Rawst

Trainer's Tournaments happen every even numbered year*, and returning Trainers are expected to appear in successive Trainer's Tournaments. This is what determines the strongest Trainer. Only Trainers with all nine Xureeni Gym Badges may enter. Being "The Champion" is more of a celebrity position than a leader position in Xureen. While at one point Chilan Shendi held this position, the most recent Champion of Xureen (according to the plot of the game I'd have in Xureen) simply goes by Mackenzie.

Mackenzie's team consists of the following:
Pawcelock (Ace), Goodra, Vikavolt, X. Thundixie, Peresteel, Rotom

The first Trainer's Tournament's battles are hardcoded. They are as follows:
Fighting Elite Trainer - Nina
Normal Elite Trainer - Cheren
Water Elite Trainer - Ciel (hardcoded to be the second to last Trainer, hence has the title "Semifinalist")
Psychic Elite Trainer - Anki
Champion Mackenzie (referred to as "Finalist" in the Trainer's Tournament, though can be battled outside the tournament)
