To install this script is a one step process.
Step 1: Drag and drop the folder in this archive into your 
project's root folder. The "Root" folder is the same folder that
has "Game.rxproj" in it.

I made this to see if I could, to test what I knew and retained
about rgss coding. I picked something I was very familiar with
and attempted to recreate it at a foundational level. This is,
technically speaking, fully functional, with minimal assembly
required.

# PokeGacha System - Bringing the worst outcome of microtransactions to life!
# By: DerxwnaKapsyla, with considerable help from Vendily and Lucidious89
#===============================================================================
# This system will allow you to add a gacha system to your project. In its
# current state, this only allows for a Single Pull, or a Ten Pull. I have
# no plans at the moment to accept non-standard denominations (5, 20, 300, etc).
# 
# The system requires an item to be consumed on every use. By default this is
# defined as Comet Shards. This can be changed by editing relevant lines. In
# future versions, this will be a setting that users can change.
#
# By default the system uses flags defined on species defined in Pokemon.txt
# to determine rarity. You could totally find another way to do it, this is just
# the one I went with.
#
# Future versions will allow for more robust "banner" creation, which you can
# use to make your own rules for the rarity, species to be included, etc.
# 
# In its current state, this only works for species defined in Pokemon.txt and
# Pokemon_Forms.txt. Future versions may include a way to do the system for
# items as well.
#
# There are currently no animations. Future versions should rectify this.
#
# This also comes with a system to mass flag species, as well as a system to
# mass unflag species. They can be called with the following lines in an event's
# script command:
#
# "compile_gacha_flags" # Mass Flag Adder
# "remove_gacha_flags"  # Mass Flag Remover
#
# If you want a species to be blacklisted from the Gacha, for whatever reason,
# you would add the following flag to that species in Pokemon.txt and
# Pokemon_Forms.txt:
#
# "ExcludeFromRandomSearch"
#
# If you somehow make this system pay-to-use with real money I will find you,
# and I will subject you to 4 Dimensional Chess against an AI that has no idea
# how to play chess so it keeps making up rules.
#===============================================================================
# To call the system in game, you would use this following line in an event's
# script command:
#
# "pgPokeGacha"
