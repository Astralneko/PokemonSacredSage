#==================================================================================================#
# This simply allows for the capability to have sounds on step.
# 
# To actually use, you'll need to define the step sound effect for the tile in
#   the TerrainTag script section, adding the following line to each terraintag:
# :sound_effect           => ["(filename)",(volume),(pitch)]
#   Replace (filename) with a sound file within the SE folder. For example,
# :sound_effect           => ["Step/Grass",100,100]
#   will set the sound effect to Step/Grass, which is recommended for tall grass.
# Replace (volume) with the volume as a percent. 100 is full blast.
# Replace (pitch) with the pitch modifier. 100 is the default.
#
# If the sound effect doesn't need its volume or pitch modified, you can simply
#   remove the array brackets (the []) and define it as:
# :sound_effect           => "Step/Grass"
#
# You will need to place the sound effect for those tiles in the SE folder,
# and set the tiles that should play that sound to the proper TerrainTag.
# 
# By default, the step sound effect will be the provided sound files:
# - Step/Wood if indoors
# - Step/Default if outdoors and the map is not a cave (as defined in map environment metadata)
# - Step/Rock if outdoors and the map is a cave
# Therefore, tiles that should use this sound effect do not need a sound_effect item in TerrainTag.
#
# The sound files do not *need* to be in a Step folder, but they will need to be for the default sounds.
#==================================================================================================#

# Game Variable number that stores what event is treated as the "listener" for Sounds On Step/Default
# This should be whatever event the player is focusing on at this point, or 0 if the player is focusing on the player's event
