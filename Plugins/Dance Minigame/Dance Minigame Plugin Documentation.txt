❓ How do I find out the bpm?

You can use:
 https://vocalremover.org/pt/key-bpm-finder 

to identify the bpm of the song, but ATTENTION: it needs to be an mp4 file for the site to identify the bpm, so I recommend copying the music file you want to find out the bpm for, converting it to .mp4 and then uploading it to the site for it to identify.
