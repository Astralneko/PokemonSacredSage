Story Progress is a set of four digit values with the following format:
XXYZ
where XX is the chapter of the story, Y is a section of the chapter, Z is the "page" within the story
Optional content that is completely seperate from any story segment (e.g. Twilight League Gyms, hooligan handling) should use Switches instead of using any Story Progress variable.
On-map puzzles (Gym or otherwise) should use Switches or normal Variables instead of using a Story Progress variable, unless the puzzle being completed is part of a Story Progress segment.
So for example, Rocavideo Gym's water position and Veriachi Gym's player level are stored separately. Himnora Kasteloj's six fountain director positions are stored separately, but each pool's status is technically part of Story Progress, as their status is directly related to the Team Xibal battles in the area.

Each time XX is updated, a small ditty should play for the change in chapter accompanied with a graphic stating the new chapter's entry.

There are also two Fun Values (named after the Undertale variable of the same name).
These are variables 998 and 999.
998 is the temporary variant, while 999 is the global variant.
There is nothing planned to use the Fun Values currently. It might be used to influence some gift Pokémon later on.
